# Sistema Diedrico (Dihedral System)
The dihedral system is a drawing method that allows three-dimensional objects to be represented on a plane. It is based on projecting the object onto two mutually perpendicular planes.

I'm currently studing this and I find it quite challenging when I'm not focused enough to try and comprehend where/how these drawings whould actually be in 3D. So I tried to find a program that would to this for me: I couldn't find it, so I decided to make my own.

This program allows you to represent points, lines and planes on both a 3D space and a dihedral system representation.
Some UI text is writen in Spanish* (sorry)

# Compiling
Requirements:
- Cmake (3.14 at least)
- Python3 (Glad needs it)
- Any C++ 17 compiler

### TODO: Web build
I want to make this project accesible to anyone so I've tried to add Emscripten support. It doesn't work at the moment (help me)
